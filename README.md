# JS13kGames 2017
[JS13kGames](https://js13kgames.com) is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 game developers. The fun part of the competition is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. 

This repo is for my [2017 entry](https://js13kgames.com/entries/mazeren). I'm not really an HTML5 game developer, but I had fun with this and learned a lot. Details of the game are below.
